When I googled this, I found it was a rather common problem for people to get the canvas element to work with react. So I made this simple boilerplate, free for anyone to use, to get started with canvas in React quick and easy.

This is my own solution of how to add an image to the canvas element in a react-project, using hooks and styled-components. If you have a better way, please use and share that. Thanks.

This is just the boilerplate so borders, sizes and such can easily be changed.
